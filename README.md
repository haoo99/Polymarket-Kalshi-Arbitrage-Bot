## 📖 What is Polymarket-Kalshi-Arbitrage-Bot?

This software helps you automatically find price differences between two prediction markets: Polymarket and Kalshi. It buys low on one platform and sells higher on the other. This process is called arbitrage. The bot works 24/7 to spot these chances quickly and take action.

If you want to try trading on Polymarket and Kalshi without watching the markets all day, this bot can help. It uses data from both sites and tries to get small, steady profits by trading automatically.
